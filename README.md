# MyReads

## Description

Project for Udacity's React Fundamentals.

MyReads is an application that lets you catalog books in three categories:

- Currently reading
- Want to read
- Read

The application connects to an API to fetch books already added to the user's catalog. Additionally, new books can be added to the user's catalog by searching the API's catalog.

Books in the user's catalog can be moved between the categories mentioned above. These changes are persisted in the API, and are available
after a page refresh. The user catalog can be reset by removing the `token` key-value pair from the browser's local storage.
